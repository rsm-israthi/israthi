If treatment was truly randomly assigned, we should not observe a statistically significant difference in this variable across groups. We test this using both a two-sample t-test and a linear regression.\n\n# Load required package\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Clean the data\ndf_clean &lt;- df %&gt;% filter(!is.na(mrm2))\n\nTwo-sample t-test:\n\nlibrary(broom)\ntidy(t.test(mrm2 ~ treatment, data = df_clean))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 10\n  estimate estimate1 estimate2 statistic p.value parameter conf.low conf.high\n     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1  -0.0137      13.0      13.0    -0.120   0.905    33394.   -0.238     0.211\n# ℹ 2 more variables: method &lt;chr&gt;, alternative &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\nLinear regression:\n\nlibrary(broom)\n# Run regression\nmodel &lt;- lm(mrm2 ~ treatment, data = df_clean)\n# Format output\ntidy(model)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  term        estimate std.error statistic p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)  13.0       0.0935   139.      0    \n2 treatment     0.0137    0.115      0.119   0.905\n\n\n\n\nAnalysis:\nAs expected, both the t-test and the regression yield the same estimate and same p-value. The coefficient on treatment from the regression indicates the difference in average months since last donation between the treatment and control groups.\nIf this difference is not statistically significant (p &gt; 0.05), it supports the idea that treatment was assigned randomly and not correlated with past donation behavior.\nThis logic is also why Table 1 is included in the original Karlan and List paper — to show that observable characteristics are balanced across groups. If they weren’t, we might worry that any difference in giving could be due to those differences rather than the treatment itself."

The red dashed line shows the true underlying difference in means (0.004).\nAs the number of draws increases, the cumulative average steadily converges to the true difference of 0.004. This is a direct visual confirmation of the Law of Large Numbers: with enough observations, our sample estimate gets arbitrarily close to the population truth.\nThis simulation helps illustrate why large samples are powerful — they reduce noise and allow the average to stabilize around the expected value.\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem\nThe Central Limit Theorem (CLT) tells us that the sampling distribution of the sample mean will approach a normal distribution as the sample size increases — even if the underlying data is binary.\nTo demonstrate this, we simulate 1,000 experiments for different sample sizes and observe how the distribution of average treatment effects changes.\n\nset.seed(42)\n\n# Simulation parameters\nsample_sizes &lt;- c(50, 200, 500, 1000)\nn_sims &lt;- 1000\n\n# Function to simulate average differences for a given sample size\nsimulate_diffs &lt;- function(n) {\n  replicate(n_sims, {\n    control &lt;- rbinom(n, 1, 0.018)\n    treat &lt;- rbinom(n, 1, 0.022)\n    mean(treat) - mean(control)\n  })\n}\n\n# Run simulations\ndiff_list &lt;- lapply(sample_sizes, simulate_diffs)\nnames(diff_list) &lt;- paste(\"n =\", sample_sizes)\n\n# Plot histograms\npar(mfrow = c(2, 2))\nfor (i in seq_along(diff_list)) {\n  hist(diff_list[[i]], breaks = 30, main = paste(\"Sample Size\", sample_sizes[i]),\n       xlab = \"Average Treatment - Control\", col = \"lightblue\", border = \"white\")\n  abline(v = 0, col = \"red\", lwd = 2, lty = 2)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpretation Each histogram shows the sampling distribution of the difference in means (treatment - control) for 1,000 simulated experiments at a given sample size.\n\nAt n = 50, the distribution is wide and bumpy, and 0 is well within the bulk, reflecting high variability.\nAs n increases to 200, 500, and 1000, the distribution becomes narrower and more bell-shaped.\nBy n = 1000, the distribution is quite tight and centered around the true difference (~0.004), and 0 lies clearly in the tail.\n\nThis confirms the CLT: with larger sample sizes, the sampling distribution of the mean difference becomes approximately normal, and extreme values (like 0) become less probable if the true effect is nonzero."

Do each as a t-test and separately as a linear regression, and confirm you get the exact same results from both methods. When doing a t-test, use the formula in the class slides. When doing the linear regression, regress for example mrm2 on treatment and look at the estimated coefficient on the treatment variable.

This result aligns with Table 2A, Panel A, which shows the response rate increased from 1.8% (control) to 2.2% (treatment).\nThis suggests that even subtle changes in messaging — such as adding a matching donation offer — can meaningfully influence behavior. It highlights that people are responsive to perceived leverage in giving: when told their gift will be matched, they are slightly more likely to give, even though the gift itself costs them the same amount.\nThis finding supports a key behavioral insight: framing matters. When giving feels more “impactful,” people are more inclined to act, even if the actual mechanics of the donation haven’t changed."

The binary outcome variable is gave, and the sole explanatory variable is treatment.\nThis reproduces Column 1 of Table 3 from Karlan & List (2007), which shows the marginal effect of being in the treatment group.\n\nlibrary(margins)\n\n# Reuse the probit model\nprobit_model &lt;- glm(gave ~ treatment, data = df, family = binomial(link = \"probit\"))\n\n\n\n  0.004313\n\n\n\nDifferences between Match Rates\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\nTo test whether larger match ratios (2:1 or 3:1) significantly affect the likelihood of donating compared to the 1:1 match ratio, I conduct a series of t-tests on the binary gave outcome within the treatment group.\n\n# Filter only people in the treatment group\ntreat_only &lt;- df %&gt;% filter(treatment == 1)\n\n# T-test: 1:1 vs 2:1\nt1_vs_2 &lt;- t.test(gave ~ ratio2, data = treat_only %&gt;% filter(ratio2 + ratio3 == 0 | ratio2 == 1))\n\n# T-test: 1:1 vs 3:1\nt1_vs_3 &lt;- t.test(gave ~ ratio3, data = treat_only %&gt;% filter(ratio2 + ratio3 == 0 | ratio3 == 1))\n\n# Show results\ntidy(t1_vs_2)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 10\n  estimate estimate1 estimate2 statistic p.value parameter conf.low conf.high\n     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 -0.00188    0.0207    0.0226    -0.965   0.335    22225. -0.00571   0.00194\n# ℹ 2 more variables: method &lt;chr&gt;, alternative &lt;chr&gt;\n\ntidy(t1_vs_3)\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 10\n  estimate estimate1 estimate2 statistic p.value parameter conf.low conf.high\n     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 -0.00198    0.0207    0.0227     -1.02   0.310    22215. -0.00582   0.00185\n# ℹ 2 more variables: method &lt;chr&gt;, alternative &lt;chr&gt;\n\n\nInterpretation These t-tests compare the proportion of people who donated at:\n1:1 match (baseline group where ratio2 = 0 and ratio3 = 0) 2:1 match (ratio2 = 1) 3:1 match (ratio3 = 1)\nIf the p-values are high (e.g. &gt; 0.05), we fail to reject the null hypothesis — meaning there’s no statistically significant difference in donation likelihood between the higher match and the baseline 1:1.\nThis would support the authors’ conclusion on page 8 that:\n“… larger match ratios had no additional impact.”\nInsight: While offering a match boosts donations overall, increasing the size of the match doesn’t lead to a further increase. People respond to the presence of a match — not its generosity.\n\n\nRegression: Do Higher Match Ratios Increase Donations?\nTo more formally assess whether the match ratio impacts the likelihood of donating, we run a regression of gave on three binary indicators for match ratio.\nWe create dummy variables for each match level: - ratio1: 1:1 match - ratio2: 2:1 match - ratio3: 3:1 match\nSince all treatment group members received one of these three match offers, these indicators are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive.\n\n# Create dummy variable for 1:1 match\ndf &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  mutate(ratio1 = ifelse(ratio2 == 0 & ratio3 == 0, 1, 0))\n\n# Filter treatment group only\ntreat_df &lt;- df %&gt;% filter(treatment == 1)\n\n# Regression: gave ~ ratio1 + ratio2 + ratio3\nmodel_ratios &lt;- lm(gave ~ ratio1 + ratio2 + ratio3, data = treat_df)\n\n# Tidy the result\ntidy(model_ratios)\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 5\n  term         estimate std.error statistic   p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)  0.0227     0.00139   16.3     9.44e-60\n2 ratio1      -0.00198    0.00197   -1.01    3.13e- 1\n3 ratio2      -0.000100   0.00197   -0.0508  9.59e- 1\n4 ratio3      NA         NA         NA      NA       \n\n\nInterpretation The coefficients on ratio2 and ratio3 represent the difference in probability of donating relative to the omitted group (1:1 match). The baseline category (ratio1 = 1) is captured by the intercept. If the coefficients on ratio2 and ratio3 are not statistically significant (p &gt; 0.05), this provides further evidence that larger match ratios do not meaningfully boost response rates.\nThis finding is consistent with the earlier t-tests and the authors’ claim that “larger match ratios had no additional impact.”\n\n\nComparing Response Rates Across Match Ratios\nWe compare whether increasing the size of the match — from 1:1 to 2:1, and from 2:1 to 3:1 — leads to a higher response rate (i.e., probability of donation).\n\n\n1.

This reinforces the behavioral insight that the presence of a match not only increases participation but also increases the total dollars raised.\n\n\nSize of Charitable Contribution (Conditional on Donating)\nNext, we restrict the data to only those who actually donated (gave == 1) and repeat the analysis. This helps us understand whether the treatment affected how much people gave, among those who chose to give.\n\n# Filter to donors only\ndf_donors &lt;- df %&gt;% filter(gave == 1)\n\n# T-test: donation amount by treatment (among donors)\ntidy(t.test(amount ~ treatment, data = df_donors))\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 10\n  estimate estimate1 estimate2 statistic p.value parameter conf.low conf.high\n     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;\n1     1.67      45.5      43.9     0.585   0.559      557.    -3.94      7.27\n# ℹ 2 more variables: method &lt;chr&gt;, alternative &lt;chr&gt;\n\n# Linear regression: donation amount on treatment\nlm_donors &lt;- lm(amount ~ treatment, data = df_donors)\ntidy(lm_donors)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n  &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 (Intercept)    45.5       2.42    18.8   5.47e-68\n2 treatment      -1.67      2.87    -0.581 5.61e- 1\n\n\nInterpretation The regression coefficient on treatment now tells us whether people who gave donated more if they were offered a match. According to Table 2A of the paper, conditional donation amounts are about the same across groups — around $45. So you’ll likely find the treatment coefficient is small and statistically insignificant.\nConclusion: The treatment increased the number of people who gave, and therefore increased total revenue, but it did not significantly change the donation size among those who were already going to donate.\nCausal Interpretation The treatment effect on donation size (conditional on giving) does not have a clean causal interpretation. Because we’re conditioning on a post-treatment behavior (gave == 1), which introduces selection bias. The people who gave in the control group may be different (in motivation, wealth, etc.) than those who gave in the treatment group. So the result is descriptive, not causal — it’s still interesting, but we can’t claim the match offer caused people to give more per person among givers.\n\n\nDistribution of Donation Amounts Among Donors\nTo better understand the distribution of how much people gave, we plot histograms of donation amounts for both treatment and control groups — limited to only those who donated. Each plot includes a red vertical line marking the mean donation for that group.\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Filter to only donors\ndf_donors &lt;- df %&gt;% filter(gave == 1)\n\n# Compute group means\nmean_donations &lt;- df_donors %&gt;%\n  group_by(treatment) %&gt;%\n  summarise(avg = mean(amount))\n\n# Histogram for Control Group\nggplot(df_donors %&gt;% filter(treatment == 0), aes(x = amount)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = \"lightblue\", color = \"white\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = mean_donations$avg[mean_donations$treatment == 0],\n             color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\", linewidth = 1) +\n  labs(title = \"Control Group: Distribution of Donation Amounts\",\n       x = \"Donation Amount\", y = \"Number of Donors\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Histogram for Treatment Group\nggplot(df_donors %&gt;% filter(treatment == 1), aes(x = amount)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = \"orange\", color = \"white\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = mean_donations$avg[mean_donations$treatment == 1],\n             color = \"red\", linetype = \"dashed\", linewidth = 1) +\n  labs(title = \"Treatment Group: Distribution of Donation Amounts\",\n       x = \"Donation Amount\", y = \"Number of Donors\") +\n  theme_minimal()"
